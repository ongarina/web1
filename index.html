  <h2>FILM FESTIVAL</h2>
  <p>A film festival is an organized, extended presentation of films in one or more cinemas or screening venues, usually in a single city or region. Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors.[1] Films may be of recent date and, depending upon the festival's focus, can include international and domestic releases. Some festivals focus on a specific film-maker or genre (e.g., film noir) or subject matter (e.g., horror film festivals).</p>
    <p>A number of film festivals specialise in short films of a defined maximum length. Film festivals are typically annual events. Some film historians, including Jerry Beck,[2] do not consider film festivals official releases of film.</p>
<p>The most prestigious film festivals in the world are generally considered to be Cannes, Berlin, and Venice.[3] These festivals are sometimes called the "Big Three."[4][5][6] The Toronto International Film Festival is North America's most popular festival in terms of attendance; Time wrote it had "grown from its place as the most influential fall film festival to the most influential film festival, period."[7] The Venice Film Festival is the oldest film festival in the world.</p>
